# Economic Horizon

After once receiving some money from relatives, I had a hard time deciding on the smartest place to
put them. With car loans, house loans, funds and other means of saving, sources online usually seem
to lean towards downpaying the loans with highest interest. What is the reason for this, and under
what conditions would this be subject to change?

I started out first drafting up an Excel sheet that became rather large and tedious, and with recent
efforts into understanding both Next.js and Remixjs, I had yet to try a modern alternative to a
single-page alternative after `create-react-app` seemed to go out of fashion. Vite seemed
interesting. Wanting to try my hand at d3 (by Observable), I landed on instead creating a small
(knock on wood) web-application that boils the calculations down to a simple user interface and a
nice visual representation.
